            In this demo, Agenda view is set as active view on Scheduler and made its
            <code>AllowVirtualScrolling</code> option as false. With this settings, the Agenda view loads the initial data for the next 7 days count from the date
            value assigned to the
            <code>SelectedDate</code> property of the Scheduler. The initial data loading for 7 days count is due to the default value assigned to the
            <code>AgendaDaysCount</code> property which can be customized as per the user needs.
        </p>
        <p>
            When the
            <code>AllowVirtualScrolling</code> property is set to true, the user is allowed to scroll through all the events simply by scrolling up and down upto
            the last event available in Scheduler.
        </p>
        <p>
            By default, the days which doesn't have any events will be hidden on this view - but by setting
            <code>HideEmptyAgendaDays</code> property to false will allow the
            <code>No Events</code> text to be displayed against the dates that has no events.
