            In this demo, the working days of a week can be set on Scheduler using the
            <code>WorkDays</code> property which accepts the collection of day indexes (from 0 to 6) of a week. By default, it is set to
            <code>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</code> and in this demo, it has been set to
            <code>[1, 3, 5]</code> which means that
            <code>Monday, Wednesday, Friday</code> is being set as working days of a week and is visually differentiated from non-working days. The working hours usually
            applies only on these given working days.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first day of the week can also be set on the Schedule by making use of the
            <code>FirstDayOfWeek</code> property, doing so which will make the Scheduler to start with that day.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Note: </strong> Here, Sunday is always denoted as 0, Monday as 1 and so on.
