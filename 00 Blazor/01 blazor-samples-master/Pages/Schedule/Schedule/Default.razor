            This demo showcases how the flat Schedule looks like with its default set of minimal configurations. Here, some
            of the documentary shows are displayed as events parallel to its relevant telecast timings. The show names are
            given as event's subject and simply notified of the start and end of it.

            The Scheduler, a.k.a. event calendar, facilitates almost all calendar features, thus allowing users
            to manage their time efficiently. It features easy resource scheduling, appointments rescheduling through
            editor pop-ups, drag and drop, and a resizing action. It includes wide variety of view modes with unique
            configuration options for each view. The available view modes are listed below, out of which the <code>Week</code>
            view is set as active.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Day</li>
            <li>Week</li>
            <li>Work Week</li>
            <li>Month</li>
            <li>Agenda</li>
            <li>Month Agenda</li>
            <li>Timeline Day</li>
            <li>Timeline Week</li>
            <li>Timeline Work Week</li>
            <li>Timeline Month</li>

        </ul>
        <p>
            To navigate between views and dates, the navigation options are available at the Scheduler header bar and the
            active view option is highlighted by default. The date range of the active view will also be displayed in the
            header bar, clicking on which will open a calendar popup for ease of desired date selection.

                            popup remains in opened state, showing the count of the number of events selected.
