After pre-rendering has completed, client-side SignalR establishes a connection to the server, and your app is rendered. This time (second time the method OnInitializedAsync is called) UriHelper.NavigateTo("/counter"); is properly executed, and we are happily navigated to the counter page (first time)
It makes page rendering quicker in some circumstances.
